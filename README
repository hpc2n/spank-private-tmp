This is a SPANK plugin for Slurm that can create private temporary
directories for each job. This is useful for /tmp, /var/tmp and other
node-local temporary directories.

The implementation uses unshare(CLONE_NEWNS) to unshare the mount
namespace and then bind mounts the private directories.

If you have issues please let us know or fix it and send us a patch.

Configuration parameters
------------------------

The SPANK plugin use the following parameters.

base:   For each job the plugin will create a directory named
        $base.$SLURM_JOB_ID.$SLURM_RESTART_COUNT

mount:  Private mount point. This can be specified more than once.

        For each mount, a directory will be created in the base dir
        and then bind mounted on the specified mount point.

Example
-------

plugstack.conf:

required  private-tmpdir.so  base=/tmp/slurm mount=/var/tmp mount=/tmp

When a job with jobid 100 and restart count 0, the following
directories will be created on compute nodes:

 /tmp/slurm.100.0
 /tmp/slurm.100.0/var_tmp
 /tmp/slurm.100.0/tmp

In private namespaces the following bind mounts are done:

  /tmp/slurm.100.0/var_tmp on /var/tmp
  /tmp/slurm.100.0/tmp     on /tmp

Note: In this example it is important that mount=/tmp is specified
      last, since after /tmp/slurm.100.0/tmp is bind mounted on /tmp
      directories in /tmp/slurm.* can no longer be accessed.

Cleanup
-------

The plugin does not do any cleanup.

See below for an example of how to remove temporary directories from
Slurms Epilog script.

Epilog example
--------------

#!/bin/bash
#
# Slurm Epilog script that removes directories created by the
# private-tmpdir SPANK plugin.
#
# TMPDIR_BASE needs to match the configured base= in plugstack.conf
TMPDIR_BASE=/tmp/slurm
PRIVATE_TMPDIR="${TMPDIR_BASE}.${SLURM_JOB_ID}.${SLURM_RESTART_COUNT:=0}"
if [ -d "${PRIVATE_TMPDIR}" ]; then
   rm -rf "${PRIVATE_TMPDIR}"
fi
